Created a small Food order Website.
In this project the best thing I learnt is how to create a menu table through JavaScript dynamically. Along with learnt query Selectors implemented them to calculate total bill. Also create a carousel of reviews.
In basics it was a practice of HTML and CSS I learnt earlier.
